# SpoonOS Developer Call - Season 1

## Overview

Welcome to the SpoonOS Developer Call program! This initiative aims to engage developers in building innovative solutions using SpoonOS core technologies. Through this program, we seek to validate our technology, build our ecosystem, and identify key contributors to the SpoonOS platform.

***Note: SpoonOS team will provide OpenRouter API Key to each qualified proposal.***

## Targets

1. **Technical Validation**: Attract developers to try the core functions of SpoonOS.
2. **Ecosystem Building**: Accumulate AI + Web3 scenarios and improvement ideas from real-world applications.
3. **Developer Activation**: Identify and nurture core building contributors.

## Program Structure

Participants will experience three phases of work:

### 1. Proposal Phase

In this phase:

- SpoonOS team will provide proposal [samples](./Proposal_Samples/), but developers can choose to use these or create their own.
- If using a sample proposal, developers must [submit a sample issue](https://github.com/XSpoonAi/spoon-devcall-s1/issues) in the Scoop GitHub repository for tracking.
- If creating an original proposal, it must include:
  - Problem description or pain points
  - Target users
  - Technical plan (core functions and product structure)

The SpoonOS team will review and approve proposals before developers can proceed to the coding phase.
**Once your proposal is approved, SpoonOS team will send OpenRouter API Key with $15 quota to the contact you left for the coding phase.**

### 2. Coding Phase

Once a proposal is approved:

- Developers can start coding their solution
- Developers can check the [GitHub Guidebook](https://x.com/SpoonOS_ai/status/1939987670215885039) for guidance
- Developers can reference the [SpoonOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/XSpoonAi/spoon-core) for documentation
- Developers can submit issues under spoon-core to:
  1. Report bugs
  2. Request features from SpoonOS
  3. Improve documentation
  4. Address development blockers
  5. Submit as a GitHub source code repository
- After submit the issue, please make sure to copy the issue link and add under your proposal issue in the spoon-dev-call repository for tracking your contribution.

The SpoonOS team will review issues and may either:

- Ask the developer to submit a PR to resolve the issue (with additional rewards)
- Fix the issue in-house

Developers who submit PRs that are accepted will receive contributor role on Discord.

### 3. Submission Phase

After completing the project:

- Developers must submit their GitHub repository link to their proposal issue
- The GitHub repository must be open source
- Developers must submit a demo video that:
  - Is less than 5 minutes long
  - Shows the project functioning on its intended device
  - Is uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku
  - Does not include third-party trademarks or copyrighted material without permission
- The project must be original work, solely owned by the submitter, and not violate any IP rights
- Popularity votes will be considered in judging (developers are encouraged to share their work on X)

## Rewards

SpoonOS offers three types of rewards to recognize different forms of contributions:

- **Issue Rewards**: For identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, or proposing features to SpoonOS core repository. These contributions help improve the stability, security, and functionality of the SpoonOS ecosystem.

- **PR Rewards**: For implementing features or resolving bugs with well-tested code. These contributions include thorough documentation and follow best practices, making substantial improvements to the SpoonOS ecosystem.

- **Project Rewards**: For completing a project demo or MVP using the SpoonOS tech stack. These contributions demonstrate practical applications and showcase the potential of SpoonOS technologies.

SpoonOS will select excellent projects for rewards based on the following levels:

| Contribution Level | Issue Reward                      | PR Reward                                                                | Project Reward                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S Level            | $200 | $800 | $500 |
| A Level            | $100 | $400 | $300 |
| B Level            | $50 | $200 | $100 |
